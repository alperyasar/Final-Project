# Final-Project
This is my CSE 495 - Final project
## LINE â€“ STATION - PASSENGER SIMULATION
This project is a public transport bus service simulation. In this simulation the
buses has departure time. Each bus line have own stations. Each bus has
capacity. The average of each distance is 2 minutes and buses changing its position
every 24 seconds. When the bus arrive to station, if there is anybody at station for bus,
it will wait until the passenger get in to bus. <br /> <br />
Each passengers get in to bus time is 3 seconds. Each minutes creating passengers
randomly. Each passenger waiting his/her current station for bus and has destination
station. When passenger come to its destination station he/she is going to get off from
bus. <br /> <br />
The main purpose of this, when 2 bus arrive to 1 station the passenger choosing
a bus. If the bus which front of has more capacity than behind bus passenger plus
passengers at station, the front bus is not waiting for passengers and all passenger
getting in to behind bus. Otherwise the passengers, in front of the queue, get in to front
bus. When the each passenger get in to the bus this condition checking. <br />
